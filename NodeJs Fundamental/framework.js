/*
Express - expressjs.com
    - Runs with Node.js, and is just on the backend
    - Is well-supprted and well-documented

What is a Web Application?
    - Have both front and back end functionality
    - Are distributed across front and back end

Express allows the client to send a request to the server, but the server cannot send request to the client and so it does not have bidirectional communication.
*/

/*
Socket.io

    - Allows real time bidirectional event based communication
    - We can push notifications from the server to the client when an event happens, as well as other data. 
    - Socket.io has two parts, a client side library that runs on the browser, and a server side library for node.js.
